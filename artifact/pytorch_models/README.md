## PyTorch Models

Run `get_relu_count.sh` in order to count the number of individual ReLU activations for the VGG-16, ResNet-32, and ResNet-18. These numbers are used for calculating garbled circuit garbling and evaluation latency as well as calculating client and storage requirements per inference.
