# Characterizing and Optimizing End-to-End Systems for Private Inference

This anonymous repo contains the codes for our submission. The high-level directories are:

1. `garbled_circuits`: contains the raw data for benchmarking ReLU Garbling and Evaluation on the embedded device and the server
2. `layer_parallel_HE`: contains our code and the raw data for enable layer-parallel homomorophic evaluation of linear layers
3. `simulator`: our PI simulator used to generate all plots and results from the paper
4. `artifact` : contains scripts to generate key figures in the paper

Please refer to the READMEs within each subdirectory to learn how we collected data and how to run the simulator.
